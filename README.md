NoCashThresholdLimits
</h1>

This mod removes the income threshold multipliers from any mode.

Originally, starting at round 50, there are multipliers applied to any income you receive from popping bloons. This mod removes those thresholds so that at any round you will receive the same amount of cash from a bloon as in round 1.

Note that this mod does NOT cause trouble for Half-Cash, or Double Cash modes. It only modifies the threshold multipliers which are unrelated to those modes.
